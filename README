 B2REX 0.2
---------------

Connects blender to realextend directly.

Features:
  - Manages ogre exporters internally.
  - Connect to opensim world and get region info.
  - Upload and clear worlds to realxtend directly from blender.
  - Material support specific for realxtend.

Installation:
  - Copy everything inside the scripts folder to your blender scripts folder.
  - Apply the provided patches for ogre exporters.
    - dotscene exporter modified to have global location offset
    - material exporter modified to have support for normal and specular maps.
    - mesh exporter modified to remove vertexColor support as otherwise materials
      would not so up on realxtend (need a better workaround for this).

Server configuration:
  - REST interfaces have to be enabled to get region info from opensim.
  - On linux xmlrpc functions on taiga-git where broken (see patch01), xmlrpc clients
    get stuck on some situations.
  - Added an xmlrpc communications component to taiga regions to manage uploading of 
    worlds (ModularRex.RexNetwork.SceneUploadReceiver) (see SceneUploadReceiver.cs)
  - Added capability to maintain uuids to the ogre scene importer.
