Installation:

 Dependencies (python 2.6):
  - greenlet (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/greenlet)
  - eventlet (http://eventlet.net/)
  - pyogp base (https://bitbucket.org/caedes/pyogp.lib.base)
  - pyogp client (https://bitbucket.org/caedes/pyogp.lib.client)
  - llbase (https://bitbucket.org/lindenlab/llbase)
  - webob (http://pythonpaste.org/webob/)
  - ogre exporter -2.5- (http://www.ogre3d.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=61485)
                  -2.49-

NOTE: Blender 2.50 uses python 3, but the part of b2rex connecting to realxtend *still* runs with
      python 2.6, so you need to have it installed, together with the above dependencies.

 Blender 2.50:
  - Copy the scripts/b2rexpkg folder to your blender "addons" folder.

 Blender 2.49:
  - Copy everything inside the "scripts" folder to your blender "scripts" folder.

Server configuration:
  - For real time connection no special configuration is needed (any running taiga 
    instance should work),
    Two patches are provided to handle some advanced usage.
        - terrain patch for incremental editing of terrain
        - modrex inventory patch to handle non grid setup
  - For xmlrpc interfacing more changes are needed and at the moment the method of access is
    discouraged, several patches are provided to enable the xmlrpc functionality needed by b2rex.
	- On linux xmlrpc functions on taiga-git where broken (see patch01).
  	- Added an xmlrpc communications component to taiga regions to manage uploading of worlds (ModularRex.RexNetwork.SceneUploadReceiver) (see SceneUploadReceiver.cs).
